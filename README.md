# LC_SpikeSorting
This repository containes files to read spike data from the TDT blocks and convert it in to .dat files. These .dat files are then used to perform spike sorting using Spyking Circus. Just download this repository and run getSpikeData.m file in matlab. The spikes_0.params file should be in the same folder as the .dat files. The map.prb file can stay on the path defined in the .params file. Happy sorting!
